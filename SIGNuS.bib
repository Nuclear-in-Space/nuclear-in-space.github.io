The mechanical properties of friction welded joints were evaluated using a combination of room temperature and elevated temperature tensile testing and creep rupture testing. The microstructural features and particle characteristics were examined using optical and transmission electron microscopy. The distribution of residual stress in completed joints was analyzed using FEM analysis. The room temperature and elevated temperature tensile strengths of friction welded joints were similar to those of as-received MA 956 base material and, in all cases, failure occurred away from the weld interface. However, the creep rupture properties of friction welded joints were much poorer than those of as-received MA 956 base material. The friction welding operation created low-aspect-ratio, fully recrystallized grains at the joint centerline and substantially altered the oxide particle chemistry, dimensions and shape in the joint region. It is speculated that the coarse, irregularly shaped particles in regions immediately adjacent to the weld interface were produced as a result of a strain-induced agglomeration of small-diameter yttria dispersoids with larger-diameter alumina and Ti(C,N) particles.},
